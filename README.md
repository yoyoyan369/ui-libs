# UI Lib Picker for Vue 3 / Nuxt 3

Choosing the right UI library is hard! There are many things to consider. This project is a simple tool to have an overview of different UI frameworks, and help you pick the right one.


### How does it work?

- Hover features to know about them, and click them to filter libraries which implement it
- For any library, you can see the detail of available components.

## Contributions

### How to Contribute

Contributions are very welcome especially because UI libraries change a lot over time. In particular, here are particularly useful contributions:

- Editing existing content (new components for an existing UI)
- Suggesting a new filter
- Improving the tool itself

There is no database. To suggest a data update, simply change data into `data/` folder and make a PR.
